# Logos

## University College of Southeast Norway / Høgskolen i Sørøst-Norge

These logos are converted from the original Adobe Illustrator format file from:

* https://www.usn.no/om-hsn/presserom/logo-design-og-grafiske-elementer/

Converting them to SVG and PDF meant a huge differentce in file size
(a few kB instead of 1.1 MB).

## Telemark University College / Høgskolen i Telemark

These old logos are kept for reference in the `HiT` subfolder.
